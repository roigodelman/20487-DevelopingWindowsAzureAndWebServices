13. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, in the **Name** box, type **Product**, and then click **Add**.
14. In **Product.cs**, change the class definition to the match the following code.

  ```cs
		public class Product
        {
           public int Id { get; set; }
           public string Name { get; set; }
        }
```
15. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.
16. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **MyFirstEF** project, point to **Add**, and then click **Class**.
17. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, in the **Name** box, type **Store**, and then click **Add**.
18. In **Store.cs**, change the class definition to match the following code.

  ```cs
		public class Store
        {
           public int Id { get; set; }
           public string Name { get; set; }
           public IEnumerable<Product> Products { get; set; }
        }
```
19. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.
20. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **MyFirstEF** project, point to **Add**, and then click **Class**.
21. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, in the **Name** box, type **MyDbContext**, and then click **Add**.
22. In **MyDbContext.cs**, add the following **using** directive to the beginning of the file.

  ```cs
		using System.Data.Entity;
```
23. Change the class definition to match the following.

  ```cs
		public class MyDbContext : DbContext
        {
           public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
           public DbSet<Store> Stores { get; set; }
        }
```
24. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.
25. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **MyFirstEF** project, double-click **Program.cs**, and add the following **using** directive to the beginning of the file.

  ```cs
		using System.Data.Entity;
```
26. Add the following code to the **Main** method.

  ```cs
		var dbInitializer = new CreateDatabaseIfNotExists<MyDbContext>();
        dbInitializer.InitializeDatabase(new MyDbContext());
```
27. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.
28. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **MyFirstEF** project, double-click **App.config.**
29. Locate the **&lt;entityFramework&gt;** element.
30. Delete the element and its content.

    >**Note**: This demonstration requires you to use Microsoft SQL Server Express and not LocalDb, because with LocalDb the newly created database will not show in the SQL Server Management Studio (LocalDb detaches the application&#39;s database after the application stops). The **SqlConnectionFactory** class uses LocalDb, so by deleting the **&lt;entityFramework&gt;** element, the creation of the database will be in the local SQL Server Express instance.

31. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.
32. To run the application, press F5.  

    The application now creates a new database on the local SQL Express, named **MyFirstEF.MyDbContext.**  
    
33. On the Start screen, click the **SQL Server Management Studio** tile.
34. In the **Server Name** box, type **.\SQLEXPRESS**.
35. In the **Authentication** drop-down menu, verify that **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then click **Connect**.
36. In **Object Explorer**, expand the **Databases** node.
37. Make sure you see a database named **MyFirstEF.MyDbContext**.
38. In **Object Explorer**, expand the **MyFirstEF.MyDbContext** node, and then expand the **Tables** node.
39. Notice that both classes defined in the **MyFirstEF** project appear as tables, **dbo.Stores** and **dbo.Products**.

    >**Note**: Database tables are usually named in the plural form, which is why Entity Framework changed the names of the generated tables from Store and Product to Stores and Products. The _dbo_ prefix is the name of the schema in which the tables were created.

40. Expand the **dbo.Products** and **dbo.Stores** tables, and then expand the **Columns** node in each of them to see that both tables have **Id** and **Name** columns, similar to their corresponding class properties.
41. Close SQL Server Management Studio.





# Lesson 3: Querying Data

### Demonstration 1: Using LINQ to Entities

#### Demonstration Steps

1. On the Start screen, click the **Visual Studio 2017** tile.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. Browse to **Allfiles\Mod02\Democode\UsingLINQtoEntities\Begin**.
4. Click **EF\_CodeFirst.sln**, and then click **Open**.
5. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **EF\_CodeFirst** project, double-click **Program.cs**.
6. Create a new **SchoolContext** object by appending the following code to the **Main** method, after the **InitializeDatabase**   method call.

  ```cs
		using (var context = new SchoolContext())
        {
        }
```
 
   You use the **using** statement to control the release of unmanaged resources used by the context, such as a database connection.
   
7. To select all courses from the database, add the following LINQ to Entities code in the **using** block.

  ```cs
		var courses = from c in context.Courses
         			select c;
```
8. To print courses and students list to the console window, add the following code in the **using** block after the LINQ to Entities code.

  ```cs
		foreach (var course in courses)
        {
             Console.WriteLine("Course: {0}",course.Name);
             foreach (var student in course.Students)
             {
                 Console.WriteLine("\tStudent name: {0}",student.Name);
             }
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
```
9. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.
10. In the **Main** method, right-click the **Console.ReadLine()** method call, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
11. To run the application, press F5. After a few seconds, the code execution will break, and the breakpoint will be highlighted in yellow.
12. In the console window, review the course and student lists printed to the console window.  

    In Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise Edition, while debugging, you can view **IntelliTrace** events in the **Diagnostic Tools** pane on the right side of the window.
    
13. In the **Diagnostic Tools** pane, below the charts, click the **Events** tab. The **Events** tab lists various events that happen during execution.  

    Events that start with "**ADO.NET:**" contain the actual SQL statements executed by Entity Framework.
    
14. Review the SQL statements executed by Entity Framework. The first set of queries is part of the database initializer code. The next set of queries is a single query to get the list of courses, and another set of queries to get the list of students, one query for each course.

     >**Notes**: 
     >1. IntelliTrace is available on Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise edition. 

15. To stop the debugger, press Shift+F5.

### Demonstration 2: Running Stored Procedures with Entity Framework

#### Demonstration Steps

1. On the Start screen, click the **Visual Studio 2017** tile.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. Go to **Allfiles\Mod02\Democode\StoredProcedure\Begin**.
4. Click **EF\_CodeFirst.sln**, and then click **Open**.
5. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **EF\_CodeFirst** project, and double-click the **Program.cs** file.
6. Go to the **Main** method, and notice that a **SchoolContext** instance is created to establish a connection to the database.
7. Review the query that is being assigned to the **averageGradeInCourse** variable and notice that the average grade of the WCF course is calculated, and then printed to the console.
8. The **ExecuteSqlCommand** statement calls the **spUpdateGrades** stored procedure with two parameters, **CourseName** and **GradeChange**.
9. To run the console application, press Ctrl+F5. Notice that the updated average grade is printed to the console before and after the change.


# Lesson 4: Manipulating Data

### Demonstration: CRUD Operations in Entity Framework


#### Demonstration Steps

1. On the Start screen, click the **Visual Studio 2017** tile.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. Browse to **Allfiles\Mod02\Democode\CRUD\Begin**.
4. Click **EF\_CodeFirst.sln**, and then click **Open**.
5. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **EF\_CodeFirst** project, double-click **Program.cs**.
6. Create a new **SchoolContext** object by appending the following code to the **Main** method after the **InitializeDatabase** method call.

  ```cs
		using (var context = new SchoolContext())
        {
        }
```
7. Query the **WCF** course by appending the following code inside the **using** block.

  ```cs
		Course WCFCourse = (from course in context.Courses 
        where course.Name == "WCF" select course).Single();
```
8. To create two new students named **Thomas Anderson** and **Terry Adams**, append the following code to the **using** block.

  ```cs
		Student firstStudent = new Student() { Name = "Thomas Anderson" };
        Student secondStudent = new Student() { Name = "Terry Adams" };
```
9. To add the two newly created students to the **WCF** course, append the following code to the **using** block.

  ```cs
		WCFCourse.Students.Add(firstStudent);
        WCFCourse.Students.Add(secondStudent);
```
10. To give the teacher of the **WCF** course a $1000 salary raise, append the following code to the **using** block.

  ```cs
		WCFCourse.CourseTeacher.Salary += 1000;
```
11. To select a student named **Student_1** from the **WCF** course, append the following code to the **using** block.

  ```cs
		Student studentToRemove = WCFCourse.Students.Where((student) => student.Name == "Student_1").FirstOrDefault();
```
12. To remove the student from the **WCF** course, append the following code to the **using** block.

  ```cs
		WCFCourse.Students.Remove(studentToRemove);
```
13. To save the changes and print the result, append the following code to the **using** block.

  ```cs
		context.SaveChanges();
        Console.WriteLine(WCFCourse);
        Console.ReadLine();
```
14. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.
15. In the **Main** method, right-click the **Console.ReadLine()** method call, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
16. To run the application, press F5. After a few seconds, the code execution will break, and the breakpoint will be highlighted in yellow.  

    The list of students appears in the console window. Notice that there are two new students at the bottom of the list, and student 1 is missing from the list. Also notice that the salary of the teacher is now 101000.

17. In Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise Edition, while debugging, you can view **IntelliTrace** events in the **Diagnostic Tools** pane on the right side of the window.
18. In the **Diagnostic Tools** pane, on the bottom part below the charts, click the **Events** tab. The **Events** tab lists various events that happen during execution.
19. Events that start with "**ADO.NET:**" contain the actual SQL statements executed by Entity Framework.
20. Notice the SQL update, delete, and insert statements that correspond to the salary update, student deletion, and the addition of the two new students.
21. To stop the debugger, press Shift+F5.
