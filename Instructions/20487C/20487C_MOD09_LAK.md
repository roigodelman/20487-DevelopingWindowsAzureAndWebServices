#### Task 2: Add a storage connection string to the cloud project

1. Open **Visual Studio 2017**.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.

3. Type **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod09\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Server\BlueYonder.Companion.sln** in the **File name** text box, and then click **Open**.
4. In Solution Explorer, expand the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project.
5. Open **web.config**.
5. Under **appSettings** add a new entry:
  ```xml
  <add key="BlueYonderStore" value="{paste the connection string copied in task 1}">
  ```
6. Press Ctrl+S to save the changes.

#### Task 3: Create blob containers and upload files to them

1. In Solution Explorer, expand the **BlueYonder.Companion.Storage** project, and then double-click **AsyncStorageManager.cs**.
2. In the **AsyncStorageManager** class, enter the following code in a default constructor:

  ```cs
		string connectionString = CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("BlueYonderStore");
        _account = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);
```
3. Replace the content of the **GetContainer** method with the following code:

  ```cs
		var blobClient = _account.CreateCloudBlobClient();
        var container = blobClient.GetContainerReference(containerName);
        container.CreateIfNotExists();
        return container;
```
4. Replace the content of the **GetBlob** method with the following code:

  ```cs
		CloudBlobContainer container = GetContainer(containerName);
        if (isPublic)
        {
        container.SetPermissions(new BlobContainerPermissions { PublicAccess = BlobContainerPublicAccessType.Blob });
        }
        return container.GetBlockBlobReference(fileName);
```
5. Press Ctrl+S to save the changes.
6. Locate the **UploadStreamAsync** method and explore its code. The method uses the previous methods to retrieve a reference to the new blob, and then uploads the stream to it.

#### Task 4: Explore the asynchronous file upload action

1. In Solution Explorer, expand the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, and then double-click **FilesController.cs**.

2. Explore the **UploadFile** method of the **FilesController** class. Explore how the asynchronous **UploadStreamAsync** method is called, and how the result is returned.
3. Explore the **Public** and **Private** methods of the **FilesController** class. Each method uploads a file to either a public blob container or a private blob container.

   >**Note:** The client app calls these service actions to upload files as either public or private files. Public files can be viewed by any user, whereas private files can only be viewed by the user who uploaded them.

 
   >**Results**: After you complete the exercise, your code will support storing files in a blob storage, either in a private container or a public container. You will be able to test your changes at the end of the lab.

### Exercise 2: Storing Content in Azure Table Storage

#### Task 1: Write the files metadata to the Table storage

1. In Solution Explorer, in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Storage** project, expand the **TableEntities** folder, and then double-click **FileEntity.cs**.
2. Add the following **using** directive to the beginning of the file:

  ```cs
		using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table;
```
3. Derive the **FileEntity** class from the **TableEntity** abstract class by replacing the **FileEntity** class declaration with the following code:

   ```cs
		public class FileEntity : TableEntity
```
4. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.
5. In Solution Explorer, in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Storage** project, double-click **AsyncStorageManager.cs**.
6. Add the following **using** directive to the beginning of the file:

  ```cs
		using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table;
```
7. In the **AsyncStorageManager** class, replace the content of the **GetTable** method with the following code:

  ```cs
		CloudTableClient tableClient = _account.CreateCloudTableClient();
        CloudTable table = tableClient.GetTableReference(MetadataTable);
        table.CreateIfNotExists();
        return table;
```

8. In the **SaveMetadataAsync** method, add the following code after the **// TODO: Lab 9 Exercise 2: Task 1.3: use a TableServiceContext to add the object** comment:

  ```cs
		TableOperation insert = TableOperation.Insert(fileData);
    await table.ExecuteAsync(insert);
  ```
9. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.
10. In Solution Explorer, in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, double-click **FilesController.cs**.
11. In the **CreateFileEntity** method, before the return statement, add the following code:

  ```cs
		entity.RowKey = HttpUtility.UrlEncode(fileData.Uri.ToString());
        entity.PartitionKey= locationId.ToString();
```
   >**Note:** The **RowKey** property is set to the file&#39;s URL, because it has a unique value. The URL is encoded because the forward slash (/) character is not valid in row keys. The **PartitionKey** property is set to the **locationID** property, because the partition key groups all the files from a single location in the same partition. By using the location&#39;s ID as the partition key, you can query the table and get all the files uploaded for a specific location. 

12. Explore the code in the **Metadata** method. The method creates the **FileEntity** object and saves it to the table.

   >**Note:** The client app calls this service action after it uploads the new file to Blob storage. Storing the list of files in Table storage enables the client app to use queries to find specific images, either by trip or location.

#### Task 2: Query the Table storage

1. In Solution Explorer, in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Storage** project, double-click **AsyncStorageManager.cs**.

2. In the **AsyncStorageManager** class, replace the content of the **GetLocationMetadata** method with the following code:

  ```cs
		CloudTable table = GetTable();
    TableQuery<FileEntity> query = new TableQuery<FileEntity>().Where(TableQuery.GenerateFilterCondition("PartitionKey", QueryComparisons.Equal, locationId));
    return table.ExecuteQuery(query);
```
   >**Note:** The location ID was used as the entity&#39;s partition key. ** **

3. In the **GetFilesMetadata** method, replace the implementation with the following:

  ```cs
		CloudTable table = GetTable();
            
    foreach (var rowKey in rowKeys)
    {
        TableQuery<FileEntity> query = new TableQuery<FileEntity>()
        .Where(TableQuery.GenerateFilterCondition("RowKey", QueryComparisons.Equal, rowKey));
        yield return table.ExecuteQuery(query).Single();
    }
  ```
4. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.
5. In Solution Explorer, in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, double-click **FilesController.cs**.
6. In the **FilesController** class, review the content of **LocationMetadata**.

    >**Note:** The method calls the **GetLocationMetadata** method from the **AsyncStorageManager** class, and converts the  **FileEntity** objects that are marked as public to **FileDto** objects. The client app calls this service action to get a list of all public files related to a specific location.

7. Locate the **ToFileDto** method of the **FileController** class.
8. Uncomment the following line:

  ```cs
		LocationId = int.Parse(file.PartitionKey),
```
9. Press Ctrl+S to save the changes.
10. Open the **FilesController** class and explore the code in the **TripMetadata** method.

   >**Note:** The method retrieves the list of files in the trip&#39;s public blob container, and then uses the **GetFilesMetadata**  method of the **AsyncStorageManager** class to get the **FileEntity** object for each of the files. The client app calls this service action to get a list of all files related to a specific trip. Currently, the code retrieves only public files. In the next exercise, you will add the code to retrieve both public and private files.


  >**Results**: After you complete the exercise, your code will support storing information about uploaded photos in Table storage. You will be able to test your changes at the end of the lab.

### Exercise 3: Creating Shared Access Signatures for Blobs

#### Task 1: Change the public photos query to return private photos

1. In Solution Explorer, in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Storage** project, double-click **AsyncStorageManager.cs**
2. In the **AsyncStorageManager** class, replace the content of the **CreateSharedAccessSignature** method with the following code:

  ```cs
		var policy = new SharedAccessBlobPolicy()
        {
           Permissions = SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Read,
           SharedAccessExpiryTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1)
        };
```
3. In the **CreateSharedAccessSignature** method, add the following code to the end of the method:

  ```cs
		BlobContainerPermissions blobPermissions = new BlobContainerPermissions();
        blobPermissions.SharedAccessPolicies.Add("blueyonder", policy);
        var container = GetContainer(containerName);
        container.SetPermissions(blobPermissions);
```
4. Complete the **CreateSharedAccessSignature** method by adding the following code to the end of the method:

  ```cs
		return container.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy);
```
5. Press Ctrl+S to save the changes.

   >**Note:** The shared access key signature is a URL query string that you append to blob URLs. Without the query string, you cannot access private blobs.

6. In Solution Explorer, in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, double-click **FilesController.cs**.
7. In the **FilesController** class, locate the **TripMetadata** method.
8. Add the following code after the **// TODO: Lab 9, Exercise 3, Task 1.4: get a list of files in the trip&#39;s private folder**  comment:

  ```cs
		var privateUris = storageManager.GetFileUris(GetContainer(id, true));
        var allUris = publicUris.Union(privateUris);
```
9. In the **allKeys** variable assignment, replace the **publicUris** variable with the **allUris** variable. The resulting code should resemble the following:

  ```cs
		var allKeys = allUris.Select(u => HttpUtility.UrlEncode(u.ToString()));
```
10. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.
11. Locate the **ToFileDto** method and explore its code. If the requested file is private, you create a shared access key for the blob&#39;s container, and then set the **Uri** property of the file to a URL containing the shared access key.
12. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project, and then click **Publish**.
13. Select **Create New** and click **Publish**
14. In the **Create App Service** dialog, enter the following values:
  - In **App Name** enter **BlueYonderCompanion09-yourinitials** (replace _yourinitials_ with your initials, e.g. - John Doe would become jd)
  - In **Resource Group** select **BlueYonder.Lab.09**
15. Click **Create** and wait until the publish operation is done.
16. Open a browser and go to **http://portal.azure.com**
17. Open **App Services** and click the web application you just published.
18. In the **BlueYonderCompanion09-yourinitials** blade (replace _yourinitials_ with your initials), in the **Overview** tab, write down the value under **URL**.
