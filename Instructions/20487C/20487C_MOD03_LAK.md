# Module 3: Creating and Consuming ASP.NET Web API Services

# Lab: Creating the Travel Reservation ASP.NET Web API Service

> Wherever  you see a path to file starting at *[repository root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides.
> e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487,
then the following path: [repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod03 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487C\Mod03

### Exercise 1: Creating an ASP.NET Web API Service

#### Task 1: Create a new API Controller for the Traveler Entity

1. Open **Visual Studio 2017**
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open** , and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. Type [repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod03\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion\BlueYonder.Companion.sln in the File name text box, and then click Open.
4. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project node, point to **Add** , and then click **Class.**
5. In the **Add New Item** window type **TravelersController** in the **Name** text box, and then click **Add**.
6. Add the following **using** directives at the beginning of the class.

    ```cs
        using System.Web.Http;
        using BlueYonder.DataAccess.Interfaces;
        using BlueYonder.DataAccess.Repositories;
        using System.Net.Http;
        using BlueYonder.Entities;
        using System.Net;
```
7. Replace the class declaration with the following code.

    ```cs
        public class TravelersController : ApiController
```
8. Add the following property to the **TravelersController** class.

    ```cs
        private ITravelerRepository Travelers { get; set; }
```
9. Add the following constructor code to the class.

    ```cs
        public TravelersController()
        {
        Travelers = new TravelerRepository();
        }
```
10. Create a public method called **Get** by adding the following code.

    ```cs
        public HttpResponseMessage Get(string id)
        {
        }
```
11. Add code to retrieve a traveler from the **Travelers** property by adding the following code to the **Get** method.

    ```cs
        var traveler = Travelers.FindBy(t=>t.TravelerUserIdentity == id).FirstOrDefault();
```
12. Add the following code to the end of the **Get** method.

    ```cs
        // Handling the HTTP status codes
        if (traveler != null)
            return Request.CreateResponse<Traveler>(HttpStatusCode.OK, traveler);
        else
            return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
```
13. In the **Get** method, right-click the first line of code, point to **Breakpoint** , and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
14. Create a public method called **Post** by adding the following code.

    ```cs
        public HttpResponseMessage Post(Traveler traveler)
        {
        }
```
15. Add a new traveler to the database by adding the following code to the **Post** method.

    ```cs
        // saving the new order to the database
        Travelers.Add(traveler);
        Travelers.Save();
```
16. Add the following code to the end of the **Post** method, to create an **HttpResponseMessage**.

    ```cs
        // creating the response, the newly saved entity and 201 Created status code
        var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created, traveler);
```
17. Add the following code to the end of the **Post** method to set the **Location** header with the URI of the new traveler.

    ```cs
        response.Headers.Location = new Uri(Request.RequestUri, traveler.TravelerId.ToString());
        return response;
```
18. In the **Post** method, right-click the first line of code, point to **Breakpoint** , and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
19. Create a public method called **Put** by adding the following code.

    ```cs
        public HttpResponseMessage Put(string id, Traveler traveler)
        {
        }
```
20. Add the following code to the beginning of the **Put** method to validate that the traveler exists.

    ```cs
        // returning 404 if the entity doesn't exist
        if (Travelers.FindBy(t => t.TravelerUserIdentity == id).FirstOrDefault() == null)
            return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
```
21. Update the existing traveler by adding the following code to the end of the method.

    ```cs
        Travelers.Edit(traveler);
        Travelers.Save();
        return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
```
  >**Note:** The **HTTP PUT** method can also be used to create resources. Checking if the resources exist is performed here for simplicity.

22. In the **Put** method, right-click the first line of code, point to **Breakpoint** , and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
23. Create a public method called **Delete** by adding the following code.

    ```cs
        public HttpResponseMessage Delete(string id)
        {
        }
```
24. Retrieve the traveler from the repository by adding the following code to the **Delete** method.

    ```cs
        var traveler = Travelers.FindBy(t => t.TravelerUserIdentity == id).FirstOrDefault();
```
25. Validate that the traveler exists by adding the following code to the end of the **Delete** method.

    ```cs
        // returning 404 if the entity doesn't exist
        if (traveler == null)
            return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
```
26. Delete the traveler from the repository by adding the following code to the end of the **Delete** method.

    ```cs
        Travelers.Delete(traveler);
        Travelers.Save();
        return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
```
27. Press Ctrl+S to save the changes.

>**Results** : After completing this exercise, you should have run the project from Visual Studio 2012 and access the travelers&#39; service.
