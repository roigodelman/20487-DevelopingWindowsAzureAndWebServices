# Module 3: Creating and Consuming ASP.NET Web API Services

# Lab: Creating the Travel Reservation ASP.NET Web API Service

 Wherever  you see a path to a file that starts with *[repository root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20487 repository resides.
 For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, 
the following path: **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod03** should be changed to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487C\Mod03**.

### Exercise 1: Creating an ASP.NET Web API Service

#### Task 1: Create a new API Controller for the Traveler Entity

1. Open **Microsoft Visual Studio 2017**.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. In the **File name** text box, type **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod03\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion\BlueYonder.Companion.sln**, and then click **Open**.
4. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project node, point to **Add**, and then click **Class.**
5. In the **Add New Item** window, type **TravelersController** in the **Name** text box, and then click **Add**.
6. Add the following **using** directives at the beginning of the class.

    ```cs
        using System.Web.Http;
        using BlueYonder.DataAccess.Interfaces;
        using BlueYonder.DataAccess.Repositories;
        using System.Net.Http;
        using BlueYonder.Entities;
        using System.Net;
        ```
7. Replace the class declaration with the following code.

    ```cs
        public class TravelersController : ApiController
        ```
8. Add the following property to the **TravelersController** class.

    ```cs
        private ITravelerRepository Travelers { get; set; }
        ```
9. Add the following constructor code to the class.

    ```cs
        public TravelersController()
        {
        Travelers = new TravelerRepository();
        }
        ```
10. Create a public method called **Get** by adding the following code.

    ```cs
        public HttpResponseMessage Get(string id)
        {
        }
        ```
11. Add code to retrieve a traveler from the **Travelers** property by adding the following code to the **Get** method.

    ```cs
        var traveler = Travelers.FindBy(t=>t.TravelerUserIdentity == id).FirstOrDefault();
        ```
12. Add the following code to the end of the **Get** method.

    ```cs
        // Handling the HTTP status codes
        if (traveler != null)
            return Request.CreateResponse<Traveler>(HttpStatusCode.OK, traveler);
        else
            return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
            ```
13. In the **Get** method, right-click the first line of code, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
14. Create a public method called **Post** by adding the following code.

    ```cs
        public HttpResponseMessage Post(Traveler traveler)
        {
        }
        ```
15. Add a new traveler to the database by adding the following code to the **Post** method.

    ```cs
        // saving the new order to the database
        Travelers.Add(traveler);
        Travelers.Save();
        ```
16. Add the following code to the end of the **Post** method to create an **HttpResponseMessage** response message.

    ```cs
        // creating the response, the newly saved entity and 201 Created status code
        var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created, traveler);
        ```
17. Add the following code to the end of the **Post** method to set the **Location** header with the URI of the new traveler.

    ```cs
        response.Headers.Location = new Uri(Request.RequestUri, traveler.TravelerId.ToString());
        return response;
        ```
18. In the **Post** method, right-click the first line of code, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
19. Create a public method called **Put** by adding the following code.

    ```cs
        public HttpResponseMessage Put(string id, Traveler traveler)
        {
        }
        ```
20. Add the following code to the beginning of the **Put** method to validate that the traveler exists.

    ```cs
        // returning 404 if the entity doesn't exist
        if (Travelers.FindBy(t => t.TravelerUserIdentity == id).FirstOrDefault() == null)
            return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
            ```
21. Update the existing traveler by adding the following code to the end of the method.

    ```cs
        Travelers.Edit(traveler);
        Travelers.Save();
        return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
        ```
   >**Note:** The **HTTP PUT** method can also be used to create resources. Checking if the resources exist is performed here for simplicity.

22. In the **Put** method, right-click the first line of code, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
23. Create a public method called **Delete** by adding the following code.

    ```cs
        public HttpResponseMessage Delete(string id)
        {
        }
        ```
24. Retrieve the traveler from the repository by adding the following code to the **Delete** method.

    ```cs
        var traveler = Travelers.FindBy(t => t.TravelerUserIdentity == id).FirstOrDefault();
        ```
25. Validate that the traveler exists by adding the following code to the end of the **Delete** method.

    ```cs
        // returning 404 if the entity doesn't exist
        if (traveler == null)
            return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
            ```
26. Delete the traveler from the repository by adding the following code to the end of the **Delete** method.

    ```cs
        Travelers.Delete(traveler);
        Travelers.Save();
        return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
        ```
27. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.

    >**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have run the project from Visual Studio 2017 and accessed the travelers&#39; service.

### Exercise 2: Consuming an ASP.NET Web API Service

#### Task 1: Consume the API Controller from a Client Application

1. Open **Visual Studio 2017**.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. In the **File** name text box, type **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod03\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion.Client\BlueYonder.Companion.Client.sln**, and then click **Open**.

5. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Client** project, expand the **Helpers** folder, and then double-click  **DataManager.cs**.
6. Locate the **GetTravelerAsync** method, and under the **// TODO: Lab 03 Exercise 2: Task 1.3: Implement the GetTravelelrAsync method**, comment remove the **return null** line, and then add the following code.

    ```cs
        var travelersUri = string.Format("{0}travelers/{1}", BaseUri, hardwareId);
        HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(new Uri(travelersUri));
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            string resultJson = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            return await JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectAsync<Traveler>(resultJson);
        }
        else
        {
            return null;
        }
    ```
7. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.
8. In the **GetTravelerAsync** method, right-click the first line of code, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click 
**Insert Breakpoint**.
9. Locate the **// TODO: Lab 03 Exercise 2: Task 1.6: Review the UpdateTravelerAsync method**, comment, and review the code of the **CreateTravelerAsync** method. The method sets the **ContentType** header to request a JSON response. The method then uses the **PostAsync** method to send a POST request to the server.
10. In the **CreateTravelerAsync** method, right-click the first line of code, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.
11. Locate the **// TODO: Lab 03 Exercise 2: Task 1.8: Review the UpdateTravelerAsync method** comment, and review the code of the **UpdateTravelerAsync** method. The method uses the **client.PutAsync** method to send a **PUT** request to the server.
