# Module 4: Extending and Securing ASP.NET Web API Services

# Lab: Extending Travel Companion&#39;s ASP.NET Web API Services

### Exercise 1: Creating a Dependency Resolver for Repositories

#### Task 1: Change the FlightController constructor to support injection

1. Open **Microsoft Visual Studio 2017**.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. Browse to <b>[Repository Root]\Allfiles\20487C\Mod04\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion.</b>
4. Select the **BlueYonder.Companion.sln** file, and then click **Open**.
5. In **Solution Explorer**, under BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers project, double-click LocationsController.cs.
6. Replace the **LocationsController** constructor method with the following code:

   ```cs
        public LocationsController (ILocationRepository locations)
        {
           Locations = locations;
        }
	```
7. To save the file, press Ctrl+S .

   >**Note:** The same pattern was already applied in the starter solution for the rest of the controller classes ( **TravelersController**, **FlightsController**, **ReservationsController**, and **TripsController** ).  
Open those classes to review the constructor definition.

#### Task 2: Create a dependency resolver class

1. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click **BlueYonderResolver.cs**, located in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project.

   >**Note:** The **BlueYonderResolver** class implements the **IDependencyResolver** interface.

2. Locate the **GetService** method, and add the following code after the **// TODO: Lab 4: Exercise 1: Task 2.1: Add a resolver for the LocationsController class** comment.

   ```cs
        if (serviceType == typeof(LocationsController))
            return new LocationsController(new LocationRepository());
	    ```
3. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.

#### Task 3: Register the dependency resolver class with HttpConfiguration

1. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project, expand the **App\_Start** folder, and then double-click **WebApiConfig.cs** to open it.

2. Add the following code at the beginning of the **Register** method to map the dependency resolver to **BlueYonderResolver**:

   ```cs
        config.DependencyResolver = new BlueYonderResolver();
	```
3. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
4. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, open the **LocationsController.cs** file.
5. Click the first line of code in the constructor method, and then press F9 to add a breakpoint.
6. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project, and then click **Set as StartUp Project**.
7. To run the app, press F5.
8. After the browser opens, append the **Locations** string to the address in the address bar, and then press Enter. The address should be: **http://localhost:9239/Locations**.
9. Switch back to Visual Studio and make sure the code breaks on the breakpoint.
10. Move the mouse cursor over the constructor&#39;s parameter and verify it is not null.
11. To stop the debugger, press Shift+F5.

    >**Results**: You will be able to inject data repositories to the controllers instead of creating them explicitly inside the controllers. This will decouple the controllers from the implementation of the repositories.

### Exercise 2: Adding OData Capabilities to the Flight Schedule Service

#### Task 1: Add a Queryable action to the flight schedule service

1. In Visual Studio, on the **Tools** menu, point to **Library Package Manager**, and then click **Package Manager Console**.

2. In Package Manager Console, type the following command, and then press Enter.

   ```cs
        install-package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.OData -version 5.7.0 -ProjectName BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers
        install-package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.OData -version 5.7.0 -ProjectName BlueYonder.Companion.Host
	```
3. Wait until the Package Manager Console finishes downloading and adding the package.
4. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, and then double-click **LocationsController.cs**.
5. Decorate the **Get** method overload, which has three parameters, with the following attribute.

   ```cs
        [EnableQuery]
	```
6. Remove the three parameters from the **Get** method and replace the **IEnumerable** return type with the **IQueryable** type. The resulting method declaration should resemble the following code.

   ```cs
        public IQueryable<Location> Get()
	```
7. Replace the implementation of the method with the following code.
   
   ```cs
        return Locations.GetAll();
	```
8. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.  
   Now you will also need to configure Web API to properly use OData. To do this, you will have to change **WebApiConfig.cs**.
9. Under **BlueYonder.Companion.Host**, expand the **App_Start** folder, and then open **WebApiConfig.cs**.
10. Add the following code to the **Register** method.
```cs
        ODataConventionModelBuilder builder = new ODataConventionModelBuilder();
        builder.EntitySet<LocationDTO>("Locations");
        builder.EntityType<LocationDTO >().Filter("City");
        config.MapODataServiceRoute(
                routeName: "ODataRoute",
                routePrefix: "odata",
                model: builder.GetEdmModel());
        config.EnsureInitialized();
```

#### Task 2: Handle the search event in the client application and query the flight schedule service by using OData filters

1. Open **Visual Studio 2017**.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. Browse to **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod04\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion.Client**.
4. Select the **BlueYonder. Companion.Client.sln** file, and then click Open.
5. If you are prompted by a **Developers License** dialog box, click **I Agree**. If you are prompted by a 
**User Account Control** dialog box, click **Yes**. Type your email address and a password in the **Windows Security** dialog box, and then click **Sign in**. Click **Close** in the **Developers License** dialog box.

   >**Note**: If you do not have a valid email address, click Sign up now and register for the service.

6. Write down these credentials and use them whenever an email account is required.
7. Open the **BlueYonder.Companion.Client** solution from the **[Repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod04\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion.Client** folder.
8. Open the **Helpers\DataManager.cs** file from the **BlueYonder.Companion.Client** project.
9. Add the following code to the **using** section:
	```cs
		using BlueYonder.Compaion.Entities;
	```
10. Locate **GetLocationsAsync** in line 86.
11. Replace the current implementation with the following code:
	```cs
	Container container = new Container(new Uri(Addresses.BaseODataUri));
    return await container.Locations.AddQueryOption("$filter", $"contains(tolower(City),tolower('{query}'))").ExecuteAsync();
	```
12. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.

    >**Results**: Your web application exposes the OData protocol that supports the **Get** request of the locations data.

### Exercise 3: Applying Validation Rules in the Booking Service

#### Task 1: Add Data Annotations to the Traveler Class

1. Go back to virtual machine **20487B-SEA-DEV-A**.

2. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **BlueYonder.Entities** project, and then double-click **Traveler.cs**.
3. Add the following **using** directive at the beginning of the file.

   ```cs
        using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
	```
4. Decorate the **FirstName, LastName**, and **HomeAddress** properties with the following attribute.

   ```cs
        [Required]
	```
5. Decorate the **MobilePhone** property with the following attribute.

   ```cs
        [Phone]
	```
6. Decorate the **Email** property with the following attribute.

   ```cs
        [EmailAddress]
	```
7. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.

#### Task 2: Implement the Action filter to validate the model

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **ActionFilters** folder in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, point to **Add**, and then click **Class**.
2. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, type **ModelValidationAttribute** in the **Name** box. Click **Add**.
3. Add the following **using** directive at the beginning of the file.

   ```cs
        using System.Web.Http.Filters;
        using System.Net;
        using System.Net.Http;
        using System.Web.Http;
	```
4. Replace the class declaration with the following code.

   ```cs
        public class ModelValidationAttribute: ActionFilterAttribute
	```
5. In the **ModelValidationAttribute** class, add the following code.

   ```cs
        public override void OnActionExecuting 
        (System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpActionContext actionContext)
        {
           if (!actionContext.ModelState.IsValid)
                      actionContext.Response = actionContext.Request.CreateErrorResponse 
        (HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, new HttpError (actionContext.ModelState, true));
        }
	```
6. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.

#### Task 3: Apply the custom attribute to the PUT and POST actions in the booking service

1. In **Solution Explorer**, in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, double-click **TravelersController.cs**.
2. Add the following **using** directive at the beginning of the file.

   ```cs
        using BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers.ActionFilters;
	```

   ```cs
        [ModelValidation]
	```
4. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
5. On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.

   >**Results**: Your web application will verify that the minimum necessary information is sent by the client before trying to handle it.

### Exercise 4: Securing the Communication between the Client and the Server

#### Task 1: Add an HTTPS binding in IIS Express

1. In the **BlueYonder.Companion** solution, select the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project, and then go to the **properties** view.
2. Change **SSL Enabled** from **False** to **True**.
3. Run the application.
   When prompted to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate, click **Yes**.
4. A **Security Warning** window will pop up asking you to install the certificate, click **Yes**.

   >**Note:** When you add an HTTPS binding to the web site bindings, all web applications in the web site will support HTTPS.

#### Task 3: Test the client application against the secure connection

1. Go back to the **BlueYonder.Companion.Client** solution.
2. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, double-click **Addresses.cs**.
