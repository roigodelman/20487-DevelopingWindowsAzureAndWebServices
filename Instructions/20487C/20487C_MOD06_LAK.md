# Lab: Hosting Services

  Wherever  you see a path to a file that starts with *[repository root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20487 repository resides.
 For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**,
the following path: **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06** should be changed to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06**.
