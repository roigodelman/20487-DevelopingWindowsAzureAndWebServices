   After you've signed in with your Azure account, the subscription field will be populated automatically and the **BlueYonderWebsite***yourInitials* (replace _yourInitials_ with your initials) folder will appear below the group of fields.  
4. Expand the **BlueYonderWebsite***yourInitials* folder, and then select the **BlueYonderWebsite***yourInitials* web app.
5. To start the publication process, click **OK**. It might take a few minutes.

    >**Note:** Visual Studio 2017 builds and publishes the application according to the settings that are provided in the profile file.

6. After the publish process completes, open a browser, and then navigate to [<b>http://blueyonderwebsite</b>_yourInitials_<b>.azurewebsites.net/api/locations</b>.]()
   An XML or a JSON describing a list of locations appears. (On Chrome - XML, and on Microsoft Edge and Firefox - JSON).

#### Task 3: Delete the Azure SQL Database Server
