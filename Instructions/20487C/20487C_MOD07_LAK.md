# Module 7: Windows Azure Service Bus

# Lab: Microsoft Azure Service Bus

### Exercise 1: Using a Service Bus Relay for the WCF Booking Service

#### Task 1: Create the Service Bus namespace by using the Azure Portal

1. In the **20487B-SEA-DEV-A** virtual machine, on the Start screen, click the **Computer** tile to open File Explorer.
2. Go to **D:\AllFiles\Mod07\LabFiles\Setup**.
3. Double-click the **Setup.cmd** file. When prompted for information, provide it according to the instructions.

   >**Note:** You might see warnings in yellow indicating a mismatch in the versions and setting deprecations. These warnings may appear if there is a newer version of the Azure PowerShell cmdlets. If this message is followed by a red error message, please inform the instructor, otherwise you can ignore the warnings.

4. Note the name of the cloud service that is shown in the script. You will use it later during the lab.
5. Wait for the script to finish executing, and then press any key to close the script window.
6. On the Start screen, click the **Internet Explorer** tile.
7. Go to the Microsoft Azure portal at **http://manage.windowsazure.com**.
8. If a page appears, asking for your email address, type your email address, and then click **Continue**. Wait for the **Sign In** page to appear, type your email address and password, and then click **Sign In.**

   >**Note:** If during the sign-in process, a page appears asking you to choose from a list of previously used accounts, select the account you previously used, and then continue to type your credentials.

9. If the **Windows Azure Tour** dialog box appears, close it.
10. In the navigation pane on the left side, click **SERVICE BUS**, and then at the bottom of the page, click **CREATE**.
11. In the **CREATE A NAMESPACE** dialog box provide the following information:

    - NAMESPACE NAME: **BlueYonderServerLab07YourInitials** (Replace _YourInitials_ with your initials).
    - TYPE: **MESSAGING**
    - MESSAGING TIER: **STANDARD**
    - REGION: Select the region closest to your location.

12. To create the namespace, click the **V** icon at the bottom of the dialog box, and wait until the namespace is active.
13. Click the name of the newly created namespace.
14. Click the **CONFIGURE** tab.
15. Click the **Copy** icon to the right side of the **PRIMARY KEY** text box.
16. If you are prompted to allow access to your clipboard, click **Allow access.**

#### Task 2: Add a new WCF Endpoint with a relay binding

1. On the Start screen, click the **Visual Studio 2012** tile.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3. In the **File name** text box, type **D:\AllFiles\Mod07\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Server\BlueYonder.Server.sln**, and then click **Open**.
4. In Visual Studio, on the **Tools** menu, point to **Library Package Manager**, and then click **Package Manager Console**.
5. In the **Package Manager Console**, type the following command, and then press Enter.

  ```cs
       install-package WindowsAzure.ServiceBus -version 3.1.1 -ProjectName BlueYonder.Server.Booking.WebHost
```
6. Wait until the **Package Manager Console** finishes downloading and adding the package.

   >**Note:** Other projects in the solution already reference a specific version of the **WindowsAzure.ServiceBus** NuGet package. Therefore, you are required to use the **Package Manager Console** to install the same version of the NuGet package. **â€‚**

7. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **BlueYonder.Server.Booking.WebHost** project, and then double-click **Web.config**.
8. In the **&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;** section group, locate the **&lt;services&gt;** section, and then inside it, locate the **&lt;endpoint&gt;** element named **BookingTcp**.
9. In the **&lt;endpoint&gt;** element, change the value of the **binding** attribute from **netTcpBinding** to **netTcpRelayBinding**.
10. Add the **address** attribute to the **&lt;endpoint&gt;** element with the value **sb://BlueYonderServerLab07YourInitials.servicebus.windows.net/booking** (Replace _YourInitials_ with your initials).
11. In the **&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;** section group, locate the **&lt;behaviors&gt;** section.
12. In the **&lt;behaviors&gt;** section, add the following configuration.

  ```cs
        <endpointBehaviors>
           <behavior name="sbTokenProvider">
             <transportClientEndpointBehavior>
                   <tokenProvider>
                     <sharedAccessSignature keyName="RootManageSharedAccessKey" key="{AccessKey}" />
                   </tokenProvider>
             </transportClientEndpointBehavior>
           </behavior>
        </endpointBehaviors>
```
13. Substitute the **{AccessKey}** placeholder by pasting the Service Bus namespace access key that you copied in the previous task.

   >**Note:** Visual Studio Intellisense uses built-in schemas to perform validations. Therefore, it will not recognize the **transportClientEndpointBehavior** behavior extension, and will display a warning. Disregard this warning.

14. In the **&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;** section group, locate the **&lt;services&gt;** section, and then inside it, locate the **&lt;endpoint&gt;** element.
15. Add a **behaviorConfiguration** attribute to the element, and then set its value to **sbTokenProvider**.
16. Locate the **&lt;system.webServer&gt;** section group, and then add the following configuration to it.

  ```cs
        <applicationInitialization>
          <add  initializationPage="/booking.svc"/>
        </applicationInitialization>
```
17. To save the changes, press Ctrl+S.

   >**Note:** Application initialization automatically sends requests to specified addresses after the Web application loads. Sending the request to the service will make the service host load and initiate the Service Bus connection.

18. On the Start screen, click the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** tile.
19. In the **Connections** pane, expand **SEA-DEV12-A (SEA-DEV12-A\Administrator)**.

21. In the **Connections** pane, click the **Application Pools** node.
22. In the **Features View**, right-click **DefaultAppPool**, and then click **Advanced Settings**.
23. In the **Advanced Settings** dialog box, set the **Start Mode** option to **AlwaysRunning**.
24. To save the settings, click **OK**.

   >**Note:** Setting the start mode to **AlwaysRunning** will load the application pool automatically after IIS loads. To use application initialization, the application pool must be running.

25. From the **Connections** pane, expand the **Sites** node, and then expand the **Default Web Site** node, right-click the **BlueYonder.Server.Booking.WebHost** node, point to **Manage Application** , and then click **Advanced Settings**.
26. In the **Advanced Settings** dialog box, set the **Preload Enabled** option to **True**. This setting will start the service after IIS starts.
27. To save the changes, click **OK**.

   >**Note:** When preload is enabled, IIS will simulate requests after the application pool starts. The list of requests is specified in the application initialization configuration that you already created.

28. Return to Visual Studio 2012.
29. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **BlueYonder.Server.Booking.WebHost** project, and then click **Build**.
30. Return to IIS Manager.
31. In the **Connections** pane, click the **Application Pools** node, in the Features View, right-click **DefaultAppPool**, and then click **Recycle**.

10. Substitute the value of the **address** attribute with the following value: **sb://BlueYonderServerLab07YourInitials.servicebus.windows.net/booking** (Replace _YourInitials_ with your initials).
11. In the **&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;** section group, add the following configuration.

  ```cs
        <behaviors>
          <endpointBehaviors>
            <behavior>
        <transportClientEndpointBehavior>
          <tokenProvider>
            <sharedAccessSignature keyName="RootManageSharedAccessKey" key="{AccessKey}" />
          </tokenProvider>
        </transportClientEndpointBehavior>
            </behavior>

  ```cs
        string connectionString = CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString");
        var namespaceManager = NamespaceManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);
```
16. Add the following code to the end of the method to create the queue if it does not exist.

It follows the same pattern of creating a **QueueClient** object in the static constructor and then sending the update messages by using the **BrokeredMessage** is applied to this controller.

    >**Note:** The **Register** method subscribes clients to flight update notifications. When a flight update message is sent to the queue, every subscribed client waiting for that flight will be notified by using the Windows Push Notification Services (WNS).
