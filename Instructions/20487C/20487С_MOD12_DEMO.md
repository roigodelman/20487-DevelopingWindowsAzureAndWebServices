```
13. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, under the **MvcApplication1** project, double-click **Web.config**.
14. Locate the **&lt;dataCacheClients&gt;** section at the end of the file, and then in it locate the **&lt;autoDiscover&gt;** element. Change the value of the **identifier** attribute to **CacheWorkerRole**.

   >**Note:** This value is used to locate the Worker Role running the cache cluster.

15. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.
16. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **MvcApplication1** project, expand **Controllers**, and then double-click **LocationsController.cs**.
17. Add the following **using** directive to the beginning of the file:

  ```cs
		using Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching;
```
18. Locate the comment _// TODO: Place cache initialization here_, and then place the following code after it:

  ```cs
		DataCacheFactory cacheFactory = new DataCacheFactory();
        DataCache cache = cacheFactory.GetDefaultCache();
```
19. Locate the comment _// TODO: Find the location entity in the cache_, and then place the following code after it:

  ```cs
		string cacheKey = "location_" + id.ToString();
        location = cache.Get(cacheKey) as Location;
```
20. Add the following code between the _comment // TODO: Add the location to the cache_ and the end of the using statement:

  ```cs
		cache.Put(cacheKey, location);
```
21. Press Ctrl+S to save the file.
22. Click the first line of the code in the **Get** method, and then press F9 to add a breakpoint.

28. Press F5 to continue running the application and display the browser. Verify you see the XML of the location entity.
29. Press F5 to refresh the page. Visual Studio 2017 opens and stops on the breakpoint.
30. Press F10 several times, until you reach the **if** statement.
31. Hover over the **location** object, and then show students that its value is set to a location entity.
