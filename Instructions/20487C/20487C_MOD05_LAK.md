   ```cs
        public string CreateReservation(ReservationDto request)
        {
        }
   ```
  >**Note:** At this point, the class will not compile because no value is returned from the method. Ignore this for now, because you will soon write the missing code.

5. In the **CreateReservation** method, type the following code.

   ```cs
        if (request.DepartureFlight == null)
        {
            throw new FaultException<ReservationCreationFault>(
            new ReservationCreationFault
            {
              Description = "Reservation must include a departure flight",
              ReservationDate = request.ReservationDate
            },  "Invalid flight info");
        }
   ```
6. In the **CreateReservation** method, add the following code below the **if** statement block.

   ```cs
        var reservation = new Reservation
        {
          TravelerId = request.TravelerId,
          ReservationDate = request.ReservationDate,
          DepartureFlight = new Trip
          {
            Class = request.DepartureFlight.Class,
            Status = request.DepartureFlight.Status,
            FlightScheduleID = request.DepartureFlight.FlightScheduleID
          }
        };
   ```
7. At the end of the **CreateReservation** method, add the following code.

   ```cs
        if (request.ReturnFlight != null)
        {
           reservation.ReturnFlight = new Trip
           {
             Class = request.ReturnFlight.Class,
             Status = request.ReturnFlight.Status,
                         FlightScheduleID = request.ReturnFlight.FlightScheduleID
           };
        }
   ```
8. In the **CreateReservation** method, add the following code below the last **if** statement block.

   ```cs
        using (IReservationRepository reservationRepository = new ReservationRepository(ConnectionName))
        {
           reservation.ConfirmationCode = ReservationUtils.GenerateConfirmationCode(reservationRepository);
           reservationRepository.Add(reservation);
          reservationRepository.Save();
          return reservation.ConfirmationCode;
        }
   ```
