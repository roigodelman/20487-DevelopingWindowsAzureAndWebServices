# Module 8: Deploying Services

  Wherever a path to a file starts with [repository root], replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20487 repository resides. 
  For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, change the following path: **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06**.

26. If a page appears prompting for your email address, enter your email address, and then click **Continue**. Wait for the **sign in** page to appear, enter your email address and password, and then click **Sign In**.

    >**Note:** During the sign-in process, if a page appears prompting you to choose from a list of previously used accounts, select the account you previously used, and then enter your credentials.

27. In the navigation pane, click **App Services**, and in the **App Services** list, click the name of the app service you wrote down at the beginning of this lab.

32. In **Solution Explorer**, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, double-click **Addresses.cs**.
33. Switch the comments between the two **BaseUri get** implementations by placing the production URL in the comment and removing the comment from the staging URL. The resulting code should resemble the following:

    ```cs
		public static string BaseUri
        {
           //get { return "http://{AppService}.azurewebsites.net/"; } // production
           get { return "{StagingAddress}"; } // staging
        }
     ```
    >**Note:** The name of the cloud service shown at the beginning of the lab replaces {**AppService**}.

34. In the **BaseUri** property, select the value **{StagingAddress}**, and then, to paste the copied staging deployment address over it, press Ctrl+V.
35. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
36. To start the client app without debugging, press Ctrl+F5.
37. After the app starts, verify that the weather forecast appears for the current trip.
38. Close the client app.

    >**Note:** The staging and the production deployments share their databases, which is why the current trip, which you created with the production deployment, appears when you connect to the staging deployment.

#### Task 4: Perform a VIP Swap by using the Azure portal and retest the client app

1. Return to the browser with the open App Service, and then click **Swap** on the taskbar at the top of the blade.
2. In the **Swap** blade, select **Staging** for source and **Production** for destination.
3. Click **OK** and wait until the swap process completes.
4. Leave the browser open, and return to Visual Studio 2017.
5. If the **Addresses.cs** file does not open, in **Solution Explorer**, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, double-click **Addresses.cs**.
6. Locate the two **BaseUri** get implementations (one of them is in the comments), and place the implementation containing the staging URL in the comments.
7. Remove the comment from the implementation that uses the production URL.
8. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
9. To start the client app without debugging, press Ctrl+F5.
10. After the app starts, verify that the weather forecast appears for the current trip.
11. Close the client app.
12. Return to the browser, move the pointer over **Delete** on the taskbar at the top, in the text box, type **Staging**, and then click **Delete**.

    >**Note:** After you ensure that the production deployment is running successfully, we recommend that you delete the staging deployment to reduce the compute-hour charges.

    >**Results**: After you complete this exercise, the client app retrieves weather forecast information from the production deployment in Azure.
