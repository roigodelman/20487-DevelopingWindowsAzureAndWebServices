# Module 8: Deploying Services

> Wherever you see a path to file starting at [repository root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
> e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06

25. If a page appears, prompting for your email address, enter your email address and click **Continue**. Wait for the sign-in page to appear, enter your email address and password, and then click **Sign In**.

   >**Note:** During the sign-in process, if a page appears prompting you to choose from a list of previously used accounts, select the account you previously used, and then enter your credentials.

26. In the navigation pane, click **App Services**, and in the **App Services** list, click the name of the app service you wrote down at the beginning of this lab.
27. On the app service blade, under **Deployment**, click **Deployment slots**.
28. In the **Deployment Slots** blade, click **Staging**.
29. In the Staging blade, copy the **URL** value.
28. Return to Visual Studio 2017. In Solution Explorer, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, double-click  **Addresses.cs**.
29. Switch the comments between the two **BaseUri get** implementations by placing the production URL in the comment and removing the comment from the staging URL. The resulting code should resemble the following:

  ```cs
		public static string BaseUri
        {
           //get { return "http://{AppService}.azurewebsites.net/"; } // production
           get { return "{StagingAddress}"; } // staging
        }
```
   >**Note: {AppService}** is replaced with the name of the cloud service that was shown at the beginning of the lab.

30. In the **BaseUri** property, select the value **{StagingAddress}**, and then press Ctrl+V to paste the copied staging deployment address over it.
31. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
32. To start the client app without debugging, press Ctrl+F5.
33. After the app starts, verify that the weather forecast appears for the current trip.
34. Close the client app.

   >**Note:** The staging and the production deployments share their databases, which is why the current trip, which you created with the production deployment, appears when you connect to the staging deployment.

#### Task 4: Perform a VIP Swap by using the Azure portal and retest the client app

1. Return to the browser with the open App Service, and then click **Swap** on the taskbar at the top of the blade.
2. In the **Swap** blade, select **Staging** for source and **Production** for destination.
3. Click **OK** and wait until the Swap is done.
4. Leave the browser open, and return to Visual Studio 2017.
5. If the **Addresses.cs** file is not opened, in Solution Explorer, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, double-click **Addresses.cs**.
6. Locate the two **BaseUri** get implementations (one of them is in the comments), and place the implementation containing the staging URL in the comments.
7. Remove the comment from the implementation that uses the production URL.
8. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
9. To start the client app without debugging, press Ctrl+F5.
10. After the app starts, verify that the weather forecast appears for the current trip.
11. Close the client app.
12. Return to the browser, move the pointer over **Delete** on the taskbar at the top, in the input box enter **Staging** and then click **Delete**.

   >**Note:** After you ensure that the production deployment is running successully, we recommend that you delete the staging deployment to reduce the compute-hour charges.

   >**Results**: After you complete this exercise, the client app will retrieve weather forecast information from the production deployment in Azure.
