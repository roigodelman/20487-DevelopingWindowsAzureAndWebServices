28. Return to Visual Studio 2012. In Solution Explorer, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, double-click  **Addresses.cs**.
29. Switch the comments between the two **BaseUri get** implementations by placing the production URL in the comment and removing the comment from the staging URL. The resulting code should resemble the following:

  ```cs
		public static string BaseUri
        {
           //get { return "http://{CloudService}.cloudapp.net/"; } // production
           get { return "{StagingAddress}"; } // staging

31. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
32. To start the client app without debugging, press Ctrl+F5.
33. After the app starts, verify that the weather forecast appears for the current trip.
34. Close the client app.

   >**Note:** The staging and the production deployments share their databases, which is why the current trip, which you created with the production deployment, appears when you connect to the staging deployment.

#### Task 4: Perform a VIP Swap by using the Azure portal and retest the client app

1. Return to Internet Explorer, and then click **SWAP** on the taskbar at the bottom.

2. In the dialog box, click **YES**, and wait until the **SWAP** completes.

4. If the **Addresses.cs** file is not opened, in Solution Explorer, under the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, double-click **Addresses.cs**.
5. Locate the two **BaseUri** get implementations (one of them is in the comments), and place the implementation containing the staging URL in the comments.
6. Remove the comment from the implementation that uses the production URL.
7. To save the file, press Ctrl+S.
8. To start the client app without debugging, press Ctrl+F5.
9. After the app starts, verify that the weather forecast appears for the current trip.
10. Close the client app.
11. Return to Internet Explorer, move the pointer over **DELETE** on the taskbar at the bottom, and then click **Delete staging deployment**. Click **YES**, and wait until the message &quot;You have nothing deployed to the staging environment&quot; appears.

   >**Note:** After you ensure that the production deployment is running successully, we recommend that you delete the staging deployment to reduce the compute-hour charges.

   >**Results**: After you complete this exercise, the client app will retrieve weather forecast information from the production deployment in Azure.
